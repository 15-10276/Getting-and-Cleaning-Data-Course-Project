# CodeBook - Tidy Data  

This is a part of a data set that recompiled the results of *“experiments \[that\] have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING,
WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its
embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The
obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70%
of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30%
the test data.”*

This new set has 11,880 rows and 4 columns which only has the estimaded values of Mean and Standard deviation for each originally selected feature. 
Now, I'm going to explain the variables in there.
